* **Age**:  Student ages.
* **Degrees**:  The programs they're enrolled in (e.g., CS, IT, AMC).

## üõ†Ô∏è  How the Data Was Added

We used these MongoDB tools to build our student database:

  MongoDB Compass:  A user-friendly GUI to visualize and manage data.We used it to add some students manually.
  MongoDB Shell:  A command-line interface for interacting with MongoDB.We used commands like:
    
    insertOne():  To add students one by one. 
    insertMany(): To add groups of students quickly.
